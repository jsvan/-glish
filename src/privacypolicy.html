<blockquote>
    I do not receive or store any information from you, not your identity, browsing history, or page information.
    The app works completely locally except for two image requests from its github project location.
    Your usage of this app is completely private with no tracking at all.

<h4>
    Purpose of Storage
</h4>
<blockquote>
    I use your browser's chrome sync storage to store your language choice and other vocabulary information.
</blockquote>
<br>
<h4>
    Purpose of Tabs
</h4>
<blockquote>
    My app peeks at your url to 1) see if it's blacklisted and not run, and 2) to see if the page has changed without firing a new page event that I still need to translate.
    This URL is not sent anywhere external or is used/collected in any other way.
