<h4>
    Purpose of Storage

<blockquote>
    I use your browser's chrome sync storage to store your language choice and other vocabulary information.
</blockquote>
<br>
<h4>
    Purpose of Tabs
</h4>
<blockquote>
    My app peeks at your url to 1) see if it's blacklisted and not run, and 2) to see if the page has changed without firing a new page event that I should translate.
    This URL is not sent anywhere external or is used/collected in any other way.
