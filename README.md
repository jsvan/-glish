TODO:
* Make instruction page
* Add way to reduce early vocab (another slider bar? Range of vocab)
* Make option for loading random translations rather than best
* Fix bug where words don't translate unless you fiddle with the Aggression popdown menu (??)
* Add pictures of what it does!
* Make sure iframes are visualized properly
* Save to git
* Look into stemmijng words etc. to find translations
