# Nosey Vocab (Foreign Vocab Learner)
Translate random common words within your webpages to a language of your choice. Learn foreign vocab in the context of an English sentence. Choose the language and the quantity of translated words. As you get more familiar with the vocab lists, you can increase the variety of words translated.
This app is intended for people who'd like to expose themselves to foreign vocabulary, but aren't sufficiently knowledgable to read foreign websites.

1) Download/unzip code
2) open chrome, go to website " chrome://extensions/ "

TODO:
* Make instruction page
* Add way to reduce early vocab (another slider bar? Range of vocab)
* Make option for loading random translations rather than best
* Fix bug where words don't translate unless you fiddle with the Aggression popdown menu (??)
* Add pictures of what it does!
* Make sure iframes are visualized properly
* Save to git
* Look into stemmijng words etc. to find translations
